# Mobile-first: touch, navigation, sheets and forms

## Targets and grip

- Minimum 44 × 44 CSS px per control (Apple 44 pt; WCAG 2.2 AA only requires 24 px, which is too small for an app used on the go); the primary action is 48 px tall (Material 3). Space targets by how they look: at least 8 px between bordered chips, about 12 px around filled controls, about 24 px between bare icons (`craft.md` section 5). Icon-only buttons get a padded hit area, not a bigger icon: `after:-inset-2.5` on a `relative` button, never a pseudo-element centred with `inset: 50%` and a translate, which lands beside the button in RTL.
- 49 % of people hold the phone one-handed, 36 % cradled, 15 % two-handed, and they switch grip constantly (Hoober). Do not design for one grip: the primary action and the controls used most sit in the lower half of the screen, destructive actions do not.
- Hover reveals nothing that touch cannot reach. `globals.css` redefines Tailwind's `hover:` variant to `(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`, so hover styles apply to real mice only; behaviour that depends on hover (tooltips, hover-opened menus) checks `event.pointerType`, because touch laptops defeat media queries. Every swipe or drag has a tap alternative (WCAG 2.5.7): a swipe-to-delete row also has a visible delete button.
- Design and test at 412 px first, then 1440 px. No horizontal scroll at 320 px (WCAG 1.4.10); the e2e `rtl.expectNoHorizontalOverflow()` check enforces it.

## Navigation

- Primary destinations are visible, not behind a hamburger: "Hiding critical parts of an application behind these kinds of menus could negatively impact usage" (Wroblewski). A bottom navigation bar with three to five labelled destinations in fixed positions (Material 3: "Don't remove the labels"). In RTL the first destination (home) is at the right end.
- Sticky bars (bottom navigation, a sticky «دیدن آگهی» bar) reduce the visible area: set `scroll-padding-block` on the scroller to the bar heights so focused elements are never hidden under them (WCAG 2.4.11), and keep sticky content under about 20 % of the viewport height.
- Back always works and always goes back. Sheets and dialogs close on Back and Escape.

## Sheets and dialogs

- A bottom sheet is for a short, single task (choose a sort order, apply filters, confirm a removal). "Do not use a bottom sheet to replace typical page-to-page user flows" (NN/g). Never stack sheets.
- Every sheet has a visible close button, a title, and returns focus to what opened it. Prefer the native `<dialog>` element (focus trap, Escape and `inert` background come free) and the APG dialog pattern for anything custom.
- Sheets slide in on the block axis (bottom), which needs no mirroring. Side drawers open from the inline end and their library prop must be set for RTL on purpose (`rtl-bidi.md`).
- Confirmation only for destructive or costly actions; everything else is undoable (removed a saved listing: show «حذف شد» with «بازگرداندن»).

## Forms

- Labels are visible, sit above the field and outside it (NN/g: "clear, visible labels that are placed outside empty form fields"; top-aligned labels are fastest and tolerate long Persian labels, Wroblewski). Placeholders are examples, not labels, and they still need 4.5:1 contrast.
- One column. Fields in the order a person thinks (make before model before trim). Ask only what the flow needs (a valuation or an alert form needs a handful of fields); one full-name field; never ask for data the app already has (WCAG 3.3.7).
- Input text at least 16 px so iOS does not zoom; zoom itself is never disabled (`maximum-scale`, `user-scalable=no` are forbidden); paste is never blocked (Vercel guidelines, WCAG 3.3.8).
- Right keyboard per field: `inputmode="numeric"` for prices, mileage, years and codes, `type="tel"` for phones, `type="email"`/`type="url"` with `dir="ltr"`. `inputmode` only picks a keyboard, it validates nothing (MDN), so normalise digits on input.
- `autocomplete` on every field it applies to (`tel`, `one-time-code`, `name`, `organization`, `postal-code`, `street-address`).
- Numbers people type (price, mileage, year, code) are accepted in Persian, Arabic-Indic or Latin digits and shown back in Persian digits. `<input type="number">` is not used: it drops Persian digits and steals scroll wheel events.
- Explain why a sensitive field is asked, right under it: «فقط برای فرستادن هشدار قیمت» under the phone field.
- Validation timing (sources disagree, this is the synthesis): validate on submit by default; validate on blur only a non-empty, format-constrained field (phone, postal code); clear the error on the keystroke that fixes it; never validate while the person is still typing in an empty field. Wroblewski measured "a 22 % increase in success rates" with inline validation done this way.
- Error text says what happened and how to fix it, inline under the field, in plain words: «شماره موبایل باید ۱۱ رقم باشد و با ۰۹ شروع شود». No «نامعتبر», no «لطفاً», no error codes (GOV.UK, NN/g heuristic 9). On submit, move focus to the first invalid field and set `aria-invalid` only after validation ran. `states-a11y.md` has the full error rules.
- Submit buttons keep their label and width while pending: `aria-disabled` (not `disabled`, so focus is not lost), repeat presses ignored in the handler, a spinner that overlays the button's inline-end padding (so the label stays centred) and fades in after the pending delay, and a wait longer than about a second named in the status line beside the button («در حال ارسال…»). A request that failed is retryable without retyping (`react-patterns`, `data-and-actions.md` §4).

## Phone and one-time-code flow (identity is phone-first)

1. Phone screen: one `type="tel"` field with `dir="ltr"`, the +98 prefix shown as text (not editable), the helper text above, a 48 px primary button «دریافت کد».
2. Code screen: one `inputmode="numeric" autocomplete="one-time-code"` field (a single field, never six boxes: pasting must work), the phone number repeated with an «ویرایش» link, a visible countdown to resend, and resend enabled after it. An expired code shows a message and keeps the screen; it never wipes the form (WCAG 2.2.1).
3. The SMS ends with `@<domain> #<code>` so browsers can offer autofill (web.dev).

## Ranges and steppers

Price, mileage and year ranges are two typable fields with words between them («از … تا …»); each accepts any digit script and thousands separators, and prices accept «میلیون» and «میلیارد». Common price bands may appear as chips next to the fields, never instead of them (*inference*). A stepper, where one is needed, has `−` / `+` buttons of 44 px with a typable field between them; in RTL the decrement is on the right and the increment on the left (NN/g). A value that is clamped or rounded is announced, never changed silently (`listing-patterns.md`).
